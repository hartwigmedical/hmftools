# COBALT

**Co**unt **ba**m **l**ines determines the read depth ratios of the supplied tumor and reference genomes. 

## Algorithm

### Calculating read depths and masking
COBALT starts with finding the mean read depth per 1,000 base window for both normal and tumor samples by counting the number of alignment starts 
in the respective bam files with a mapping quality score of at least 10 that is neither unmapped, duplicated, secondary, nor supplementary. 
Windows with a GC content less than 0.2 or greater than 0.6 or with an average mappability below 0.85 are excluded from further analysis.

### GC normalisation
Next we apply a GC normalization to calculate the read ratios. To do this we divide the read depth of each window by the median read depth of
all windows sharing the same GC content then normalise further to the ratio of the median to mean read depth of all windows.

### Diploid normalisation

The reference sample ratios have a further ‘diploid’ normalization applied to them to remove megabase scale GC biases. 
This normalization assumes that the median ratio of each 10Mb window (minimum 1Mb readable) should be diploid for autosomes and haploid for 
male sex chromosomes in addition to the following exceptions:

| Aberration                | Chromosome    | Normalized Ratio   |
|---------------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| `MOSAIC_X`                | X             | use median X ratio |
| `KLINEFELTER`             | X             | 1                  |
| `KLINEFELTER`             | Y             | 0.5                |
| `TRISOMY_[X,21,13,18,15]` | X,21,13,18,15 | 1.5                |

### Depth window consoldiation
Sparse information in COBALT may cause a noisy fit for lpWGS.  Therefore, we consolidate buckets to try to reach a median read depth of at
least 8 per bucket. The ConsolidatedBucketSize is set to = clamp(roundToOneSigDigit(80 / medianTumorReadCount, 10, 1000).   This formula allows
consolidation into buckets of up to 1000 depth windows.  For standard WGS this should have no effect as medianTumorReadDepth >> 8. We should
never consolidate across regions of more than 3Mb (so never across centromere).   Consolidation is not used in targeted sequencing mode. 

For the consolidated buckets, the mean GC ratio for both tumor and reference is calculated for the consolidated bucket and set to the centre
window in the consolidated bucket.  The other buckets are masked.

### Germline chromosomal aberrations

Post GC normalization, COBALT is able to detect the following germline chromosomal aberrations from the reference ratio:

| Aberration                | Gender | Ratio Criteria                                   |
|---------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `MOSAIC_X`                | FEMALE | X ratio < min(0.8, minAutosomeMedianDepthRatio*) |
| `KLINEFELTER` (XXY)       | MALE   | X ratio >= 0.65                                  |
| `TRISOMY_[X,21,13,18,15]` | BOTH   | chromosome ratio >= 1.35                          |

*By checking against autosomes we rule out very high GC bias in the reference.  

### Segmentation

Finally, the Bioconductor copy number package is used to generate segments from the ratio file.

## Installation

To install, download the latest compiled jar file from the [download links](#version-history-and-download-links) and the appropriate GC profile from [HMFTools-Resources > DNA Pipeline](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/hmf-public/HMFtools-Resources/dna_pipeline/).

COBALT depends on the Bioconductor [copynumber](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/copynumber.html) package for segmentation.
The R package [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html) is also used.
After installing [R](https://www.r-project.org/) or [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), the required R packages can be added with the following R commands:
```
    library(BiocManager)
    install("copynumber")
    install("dplyr")
```

COBALT requires Java 11+ and can be run with the minimum set of arguments as follows:

```
java -jar -Xmx8G cobalt.jar \
    -reference SAMPLE_ID_R \
    -reference_bam /sample_data/SAMPLE_ID_R.bam \

    -tumor_bam /sample_data/SAMPLE_ID.bam \ 
    -output_dir /sample_data/ \ 
    -threads 10 \ 
    -gc_profile /ref_data/GC_profile.1000bp.37.cnp
```

| gc_profile    | Path to GC profile                                                                        |

A compressed copy of the GC Profile file used by HMF (GC_profile.1000bp.37.cnp) is available to download from [HMF-Pipeline-Resources](https://resources.hartwigmedicalfoundation.nl). This file contains 5 columns for each 1kb window of the genome {chromosome,position,GC Proportion,Non N Proportion,Average Mappability}.  A 38 equivalent is also available. Please note the downloaded file must be un-compressed before use. 

COBALT supports both BAM and CRAM file formats. If using CRAM, the ref_genome argument must be included.

## Optional Arguments

| Argument               | Default | Description                                                 |
|------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| threads                | 4       | Number of threads to use                                    |
| min_quality            | 10      | Min quality                                                 |

| pcf_gamma              | 100     | Gamma value for use in R copy_number pcf function           |
| target_region          | None    | Target region TSV file for use in targeted mode.            |

## Tumor Only Mode
In the absence of a reference bam and reference COBALT will  be run in tumor_only mode.    

Without a means to determine which regions of the normal are diploid, a bed file specifying these locations must be included with the `tumor-only-diploid-bed` parameter. A 37 bed file (DiploidRegions.37.bed.gz) and 38 equivalent are available to download from [HMF-Pipeline-Resources](https://resources.hartwigmedicalfoundation.nl). To create this bed file we examined the COBALT output of 100 samples.  We considered each 1000 base region to be diploid if 50% or more of the samples were diploid (0.85 >= referenceGCDiploidRatio <= 1.15 ) at this point. 

As no reference data is supplied, COBALT does not try to determine gender or any chromosomal aberrations.  No reference pcf file will be created. The output reference ratios will be 1 or -1 on all chromosomes even if they are allosomes.  Downstream, PURPLE will adjust the allosome ratios according to the AMBER gender. 

## Germline Only Mode

In the absence of a tumor bam and tumor COBALT will  be run in germline mode.   Counts and ratios are only calculated and fitted for the reference sample.

## Targeted Mode

COBALT may be run on targeted data.   For more information on how to run hmftools in targeted mode please see [here](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/blob/master/pipeline/README_TARGETED.md)
