## Overview

The recommended way to run **hartwigmedical/hmftools** workflows or components is with
[oncoanalyser](https://github.com/umccr/oncoanalyser), a Nextflow implementation of the HMF pipeline.

A principal aim of oncoanalyser is provide the HMF pipeline in a highly accessible form that is usable with a minimal
set of inputs. This is achieved through flexible prefined configuration for individual tools, prebuilt Docker images
retrieved at runtime for each process, and automated on-demand staging of reference genomes and resource files. The
only required input to run an analysis with oncoanalyser is a samplesheet describing sample inputs.

Both the WGS/WTS and targeted sequencing workflows are available in oncoanalyser. The targeted sequencing workflow has
built-in support for the TSO500 panel and in future releases will be configured to work with custom DNA/RNA panels.

As oncoanalyser is written using Nextflow, it supports a range of compute environments including AWS, Azure, GCP, and
HPC. Other features include continuous checkpointing with run resuming and the ability to integrate with [Seqera
Platform](https://seqera.io/platform/), a user-friendly monitoring and management service for Nextflow pipelines.

Further information on Nextflow can be found [here](https://www.nextflow.io/) and generic configuration options are well
described in the [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html).

## Supported workflows

### Workflow inputs

The starting input for oncoanalyser are BAMs, which have the follow requirements:

| Sequence Type | Aligner | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DNA | BWA-MEM<br />(or DRAGEN) | • Supplementary alignment soft-clipping (`-Y`)<br />• Duplicate marking with the Picard algorithm |
| RNA | STAR | • Several **essential** [STAR settings](../isofox#a-note-on-alignment-and-multi-mapping) for WGTS<br />• Duplicate marking with the Picard algorithm<br />• Ensembl v74 annotations for GRCh37<br />• Ensembl v105 annotations for GRCh38 |

> [!WARNING]
> BAMs are expected to have been generated by aligning to the Hartwig-distributed
[GRCh37](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/hmf-public/HMFtools-Resources/ref_genome/37) or
[GRCh38](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/hmf-public/HMFtools-Resources/ref_genome/38) reference
genomes.

#### Available analysis types

Require inputs shown as :white_check_mark: for available analyses

| Analysis name | Tumor DNA BAM      | Tumor RNA BAM |
| ---           | :-:                | :-:           |
| Tumor only    | :white_check_mark: | *optional*    |

## Usage

### Software requirements

* Nextflow >=22.10.5 ([instructions](https://www.nextflow.io/index.html#GetStarted))
* Docker ([instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server))

> [!NOTE]
> Docker on Windows and macOS can perform poorly, so only running oncoanalyser on Linux is currently recommended.

### Input samplesheet

Running an analysis with oncoanalyser requires a samplesheet describing input files and samples. The samplesheet
contains information that allows oncoanalyser to appropriately group samples (e.g. tumor/normal pairs), locate input
files, and select relevant tools to run.

Each entry in the samplesheet represents a single input file and is connected with metadata such as sample/group
identifers, sample type (tumor/normal), sequence type (DNA/RNA), and filetype. All entries with the same `group_id`
value with be grouped together for processing, and the composition of a group determines the type of analysis run.

An example samplesheet for the WGTS workflow is shown:

```
group_id,subject_id,sample_id,sample_type,sequence_type,filetype,filepath
COLO829_example,COLO829,COLO829T,tumor,dna,bam,/path/to/COLO829T.dna.bam
COLO829_example,COLO829,COLO829R,tumor,rna,bam,/path/to/COLO829T.rna.bam
COLO829_example,COLO829,COLO829R,normal,dna,bam,/path/to/COLO829R.dna.bam
```

In this example, there is a single group (`COLO829_example`) that contains paired tumor/normal DNA BAMs and an RNA BAM,
so a full tumor/normal WGTS analysis will be run. For futher details on workflow inputs and impact on exection, you can
refer to the [WGTS workflow inputs](#available-analysis-types) and [targeted sequencing workflow
inputs](#available-analysis-types-1) sections.

Multiple groups can also be provided in a single sample sheet:

```
group_id,subject_id,sample_id,sample_type,sequence_type,filetype,filepath
COLO829_example,COLO829,COLO829T,tumor,dna,bam,/path/to/COLO829T.dna.bam
COLO829_example,COLO829,COLO829R,tumor,rna,bam,/path/to/COLO829T.rna.bam
COLO829_example,COLO829,COLO829R,normal,dna,bam,/path/to/COLO829R.dna.bam
SEQC_example,SEQC,SEQCT,tumor,dna,bam,/path/to/SEQCT.dna.bam
```

Here the `SEQC_example` has been added to the previous example. Since only a tumor DNA BAM is provided for this
additional group, just a tumor-only WGS analysis is run for the SEQC sample.

> [!NOTE]
> Input filepaths can be absolute local paths, URLs, or S3 URIs

> [!WARNING]
> BAM indexes are expected to exist along side the respective input BAM

#### Samplesheet column descriptions

| Column        | Description                                                          |
| ---           | ---                                                                  |
| group_id      | Group ID for a set of samples and inputs                             |
| subject_id    | Subject/patient ID                                                   |
| sample_id     | Sample ID                                                            |
| sample_type   | Sample type: `tumor`, `normal`                                       |
| sequence_type | Sequence type: `dna`, `rna`                                          |
| filetype      | File type: `bam`, `bai`                                              |
| filepath      | Absolute filepath to input file (can be local filepath, URL, S3 URI) |

The identifiers provided in the samplesheet are used to set output file paths:

* `group_id`: top-level output directory for analysis files e.g. `output/COLO829_example/`
* tumor `sample_id`: output prefix for most filenames e.g. `COLO829T.purple.sv.vcf.gz`
* normal `sample_id`: output prefix for some filenames e.g. `COLO829R.cobalt.ratio.pcf`

### Example command

To launch oncoanalyser you must provide at least the input samplesheet, the reference genome used for read alignment,
and the desired workflow. When running the targeted sequencing workflow the applicable panel name is also required.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting `-revision` to use a specific version of oncoanalyser is strongly recommended to improve reproducibility and
> stability.

> [!WARNING]
> It is recommended to only run oncoanalyser with Docker, which is done by with `-profile docker`.

## Outputs

The selected results files are written to the output directory and arranged into their corresponding groups by
directories named with the respective `group_id` value from the input samplesheet. Within each group directory, outputs
are further organised by tool.

All intermediate files used by each process are kept in the Nextflow work directory (default: `work/`). Once an analysis
has completed this directory can be removed.

## Future Improvements

The following improvements are planned for the next few releases:
* support for custom targeted panels
* apply HMF's MarkDuplicates & UMI-analysis to BAMs prior to variant calling
* longitudinal analysis of patient samples including ctDNA samples
* ancillary analyses for neoantigen burden
* cloud-specific instructions and optimisations (ie for AWS, Azure and GCP)
