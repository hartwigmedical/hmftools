Run the following commands as root (admin) on mysql prior to building

mysql> CREATE USER 'build'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'build';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> CREATE DATABASE hmfpatients_test;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL on hmfpatients_test.* TO 'build'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

Maven automatically rebuilds the hmfpatient_test database based on DDL statements provided
in file generate_database.sql via this additional Maven build step we are automatically 
sure the jOOQ generated Java entity code always matches the DDL statements.

MySQL database setup is triggered via setup_database.sh script that is assuming MySQL
login credentials to be provided via mysql.login located in your home directory.

Create mysql.login file:

cat ~/mysql.login << HERE
[client]
database=hmfpatients_test
user=build
password=build
HERE

For MySQL to accept the login file, make sure that the login file is only readable by you:

chmod 600 ~/mysql.login

From new any change made to the database definition in generate_database.sql is 
automatically taken into account by the generated Java code.
