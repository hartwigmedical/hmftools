* Handling of CDKN2A/CDKN2A (p16)/CDKN2A (p14ARF) which should also move to the findings model (but could be optional for NL).
* Shared interface for "GeneFindings"
    * Naming in OncoAct is inconsistent (also in the report). I think it's good to make clear that this is the same thing by using a shared interface
    * Shared by Disruption, GainDeletion, SmallVariant
    * Includes the following fields
        * Gene
        * Transcript
        * IsCanonical
        * Chromosome
        * ChromosomeBand (not in small variant)
* Consistent handling of missing / unreliable data / etc
    * Return NOT_AVAILABLE_NOT_TESTED (?) for findings that are not available for panels
        * Also make sure this is implemented correctly for different types of panels (OncoPanel, TSO500, etc.)
    * Return NOT_AVAILABLE_NO_NORMAL (?) for findings that are not available because there’s no normal
    * Handling of purity cut off
    * Consistent handling of "reliable purity" (either in this model or not)
* Move handling of germline for NL into findings model?
    * We are not allowed to report germline findings in NL
    * Any germline findings are changed to somatic, unless they are considered “germline only” (variant copy number < 0.5).
    * The germline only findings need to be recognizable as such
    * Probably necessary for UI anyway. NL UI can not show germline findings as germline findings
* Consider moving handling of driverLikelihood to findings model
    * OncoAct sets the driverlikelihood to the highest value for a gene (can change null value to actual driverlikelihood)
* Consider if we want to expose the Orange model in this model, or if we want to make this completely independent of the Orange model?
    * Downside is duplication of data structures and enums
    * Upside’s are
        * Extra level of indirection that makes it possible to deal with some type of data model changes
        * Simpler model, user of findings does not need to know about Orange
        * Could move enums elsewhere so they can be shared?
* Create shared interface between all types of findings (for FindingStatus)?
* Review all naming
    * Make sure everything is consistent and names are sensible
    * Rename Breakend to BreakEnd?
    * Rename finding package to findings?
* Consider adding good test factories that can be reused (easier with Kotlin)
* Make sure there is good test coverage
* Handling of reportable vs candidate. Right now it is a method in Driver. Perhaps it is better to make CANDIDATE a value in the ReportedStatus enum?
