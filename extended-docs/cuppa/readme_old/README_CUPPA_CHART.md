# CUPPA-chart

CUPPA-chart is a tool to create a summary figure based on the output of the [CUPPA tool](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/tree/master/cuppa)* developed for 
the [Hartwig Medical Foundation pipeline](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/pipeline5). 
It imports the output data of the [CUPPA tool](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/tree/master/cuppa)*, and creates a summary chart (spider plot) and final conclusion of that output. 

It creates two output files:
* A file that contains the summary chart of the CUPPA analyses (png format).
* A file that contains the final conclusion of the CUPPA analyses (txt format)

*CUPPA is a tool that weighs multiple genomic features observed from WGS & WTS to predict the tissue of origin of a tumor sample. It is intended to 1) provide molecular tumor type prediction to verify histopathological classification, 2) provide support for specific tumor type classification in case of inconclusive histopathological outcome (differential diagnosis) and 3)  prediction of primary tumor location for Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP).

## Installation
If you want to run CUPPA-chart, please generate a local Python 3 venv and install the requirements:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv [path/to/new/virtual/environment, for example: ./venv]
$ source [path/to/new/venv/+bin/activate, for example: ./venv/bin/activate]
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

## Arguments
Remember to source the virtualenv before running `cuppa-chart.py` (see Installation).

#### Example Usage
```
(venv) $ python src/cuppa-chart.py \
    -sample ${sampleId} \
    -sample_data ${path}/{sampleId}.cup.data.csv \
    -output_dir ${output_dir}
```

### Mandatory Arguments
Argument | Description
---|---
sample | The tumor sample ID of the run. Used for names of output files.
sample_data | Path to sample data csv created by the CUPPA tool ({sampleId}.cup.data.csv).
output_dir | Directory to write the output to.

## Input
### CSV
CUPPA-chart has been designed to work with CSV files that are generated by the CUPPA tool for the specific sample, see 
[CUPPA tool](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/tree/master/cuppa). The specific file is named {sampleId}.cup.data.csv.

## Output
CUPPA-chart outputs two files. One contains the CUPPA chart (png format), the other contains the final conclusion of the CUPPA analyses (txt format).
#### CUPPA chart file
Name: `${sampleId}.cuppa.chart.png`

Summary figure of the [CUPPA tool](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/tree/master/cuppa) analyses, in the format of a Spider plot.

#### CUPPA final conclusion file
Name: `${sampleId}.cuppa.conclusion.txt`

Final conclusion of the [CUPPA tool](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/tree/master/cuppa) analyses, in the format of "Molecular tissue of origin - [conclusion]".
If the [CUPPA tool](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/tree/master/cuppa) analyses reports that the highest predicted reference group has a likelihood below 80%, the conclusion will always be "Molecular tissue of origin - results inconclusive".
 
## Algorithm
CUPPA-chart uses the results of the [CUPPA tool](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/tree/master/cuppa) to create a summary chart and to come to a final conclusion of the [CUPPA tool](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/tree/master/cuppa) analyses.

First, the CSV output file of the [CUPPA tool](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/tree/master/cuppa) is loaded and the classifier results are filtered.
A spider chart is made using the likelihoods of the combined classifier. 

When the highest predicted reference group as reported by the [CUPPA tool](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/tree/master/cuppa) analyses has a likelihood equal to or over 80%, the title of the spider chart will show a final conclusion: "Molecular tissue of origin - [conclusion]". A barchart will be added next to the spider chart showing the results for this highest predicted reference group of the other classifiers (SNV signatures, driver landscapre and passenger characteristics, somatic mutation pattern).

When the highest predicted reference group as reported by the [CUPPA tool](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/tree/master/cuppa) analyses has a likelihood below 80%, the title of the spider chart will depict that the results are inconclusive: "Molecular tissue of origin - results inconclusive". Barcharts will be added next to the spider charts for the three highest predicted reference groups, with the condition that they should have a likelihood of over 10% (otherwise less barcharts will be shown). The barcharts show the results per reference group for the other classifiers (SNV signatures, driver landscapre and passenger characteristics, somatic mutation pattern).

The final conclusion (title of the spider chart as described in above paragraphs) will be added to a txt file. This will be in the format of "Molecular tissue of origin - [conclusion]".
If the [CUPPA tool](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/tree/master/cuppa) analyses report that the highest predicted reference group has a likelihood below 80%, the conclusion will be "Molecular tissue of origin - results inconclusive".
