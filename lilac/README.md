# Lilac

## Introduction
See the Lilac Google doc


## Configuration
To install, download the latest compiled jar file from the [download links](#version-history-and-download-links). 

### Resource Files
Lilac requires the following resource files:
- Ref Genome FASTA
- HLA allele nucleotide and amino acid definitions, generated by Lilac (see below)

Reference files are available here [HMFTools-Resources](https://resources.hartwigmedicalfoundation.nl/):

#### Generate HLA Definitions
Nucleotide and amino acid allele defintions are available here:
- https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/download.html
- ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ipd/imgt/hla/

Convert these definition files to the reference files used by Lilac with the following command:
```
java -cp lilac.jar com.hartwig.hmftools.lilac.GenerateReferenceSequences \
   -resource_dir /path_to_definition_files/ \ 
   -output_dir /output_dir/ \
```

### Mandatory Arguments

Argument | Description 
---|---
sample | Sample ID
ref_genome | Reference genome fasta file
reference_bam | Sample's germline BAM 

NOTE: Lilac handles BAMs which have been sliced for the HLA gene regions.

### Optional Inputs

Argument | Description 
---|---
tumor_bam | Sample's tumor BAM
gene_copy_number | Sample gene copy number file from Purple
somatic_variants_file | Sample's somatic variant VCF file, for annotation of HLA gene variants

### Optional Arguments

Argument | Default | Description 
---|---|---
min_base_qual | 30 | Min base quality for BAM reads, see documentation for details 
min_evidence | 2 | Min absolute required fragments for evidence phase
min_evidence_factor | 0.00075 | Min relative required fragments for evidence phase, as a fraction of total fragments
min_high_qual_evidence_factor | 0.000375 | Minimum relative required high base-quality fragments for evidence phase, as a fraction of total fragments
min_fragments_per_allele | 7 | See documentation for details 
min_fragments_to_remove_single | 40 | See documentation for details 
top_score_threshold | 5 | Maximum difference in candidate solution score vs top score as a percentage of total fragments 
log_debug | Off (logs at INFO) | Logs in verbose mode 
debug_phasing | Off | Logs phasing evidence construction 
expected_alleles | Not applied | List of alleles separated by ';'. These alleles will have their coverage and ranking reported even if not in the winning solution
restricted_alleles | Not applied | List of alleles separated by ';'. Restrict evaluation to only these alleles.
threads | 1 | Number of threads to use for complex evaluation


### Example Usage

```
java -jar lilac.jar \
   -sample COLO829T 
   -ref_genome /path_to_ref_genome_fasta_file/ \
   -resource_dir /path_to_lilac_resource_files/ \ 
   -reference_bam /sample_data_path/COLO829R.bam \
   -output_dir /output_dir/ \
```

Or with tumor BAM, somatic variants VCF and Purple gene copy number inputs:

```
java -jar lilac.jar \
   -sample COLO829T 
   -ref_genome /path_to_ref_genome_fasta_file/ \
   -resource_dir /path_to_lilac_resource_files/ \ 
   -reference_bam /sample_data_path/COLO829R.bam \
   -tumor_bam /sample_data_path/COLO829T.bam \
   -somatic_vcf /sample_data_path/COLO829T.purple.somatic.vcf.gz \
   -gene_copy_number /sample_data_path/COLO829T.purple.cnv.gene.tsv \
   -output_dir /output_dir/ \
```
