# Personalized Report On Treatment and Eligibility for Clinical Trials

PROTECT determines the clinical evidence applicable for a particular tumor sample based on all genomic events and signatures 
that are called by the Hartwig pipeline. PROTECT works exclusively on a clinical database generated by [SERVE](../serve/README.md) 
and uses a set of rules to match any type of evidence from SERVE against genomic events.

## Evidence determination per type of genomic event

Genomic events are categorized in six categories and evidence is matched for every category independently.

#### SNVs and (small) INDELs

For small variants (SNVs and INDELs) determined by [PURPLE](../purple/README.md) the following matching is performed:
 - If the evidence is defined on the exact variant (hotspot) then evidence is always considered applicable
 - If the variant falls within the range in which the evidence is applicable then the evidence is applicable if the variant mutation type
 passes the filter defined as part of the SERVE evidence rule.
 - If a variant affects a gene for which evidence is applicable on a gene level (activation, inactivation, or any mutation), 
 then the evidence is considered applicable if the combination of variants affecting that gene have a high driver likelihood (> 80%). 
 
Do note that germline and somatic variants are treated equally. It is not considered relevant for clinical evidence whether the variant is 
present in the germline already or has been acquired by the tumor somatically.   

#### Copy numbers

Evidence on amplifications and deletions is considered applicable in case a gene has been classified as amplified or deleted by 
[PURPLE](../purple/README.md). In addition, a deletion is assumed to inactivate a gene and hence evidence on 
gene inactivation is considered applicable in case of a deletion. 

#### Homozygous disruptions

When a gene has been homozygously disrupted according to [LINX](../linx/README.md), evidence is applicable when it has been defined 
on a gene level with event either inactivation, deletion or any mutation. 

#### Fusions

For fusions that are deemed reportable according to [LINX](../linx/README.md) the following matching is performed:
 - Evidence defined on a promiscuous gene level is always considered applicable if a fusion with that gene is reported either in 5' or 3' 
 position.
 - Evidence that is applicable on an exact fusion pair has to match with the actual fusion pair, and also has to match the (optional) 
 exonic range defined as a restriction on the evidence.

#### Viral presence

For matching viral presence to evidence, the interpretation by [Virus Interpreter](../virus-interpreter/README.md) is used. If virus 
interpreter classified at least one viral presence as "HPV" then any evidence for "HPV Positive" will match for this sample.

#### Signatures

Evidence on signatures is matched based on the interpretation of the algorithm producing the signature. For example, when CHORD suggests a
sample is HR deficient, any evidence for HR deficiency is considered applicable.

## Determining whether evidence is on-label

Evidence is considered on-label in case the evidence is defined for the tumor type of the sample that is evaluated, or for any tumor type
that is a parent of the sample tumor type. For example, evidence on solid tumors is considered applicable for a colorectal cancer sample 
since a solid tumor is a parent of colorectal cancer.

PROTECT uses DOID exclusively for matching and expects every evidence to be defined for a single DOID entry. 

Some additional notes:
 - Since tumors could belong to multiple separate branches in the DOID tree, a tumor sample is allowed to have multiple DOIDs. In this case
 evidence is on-label in case one of the DOIDs matches with the evidence tumor type (or is child thereof).
 - The tumor sample DOIDs are optional in the PROTECT algorithm. If they are not provided, all evidence is considered off-label 
 (including evidence that is applicable pan-cancer).

## Evidence consolidation, filtering and reporting

After evidence has been collected based on the five distinct categories of genomic mutations and has been labeled as on-label or off-label,
evidence is consolidated and evaluated for reporting. The following steps are executed:
 1. Evidence is consolidated on source level. If the exact same evidence for the same event is found across multiple sources, 
 this evidence is consolidated in a single instance of applicable evidence. PROTECT has no preference for any source, though sorts sources 
 alphabetically for consistency.
 1. Evidence is filtered for reporting in case they are based on genomic events that are not reportable.
 1. Evidence is filtered for reporting based on the maximum configured reporting level for the evidence.
     - For CKB C evidence is reported, or up to B for predicted evidence
     - For VICC and iClusion evidence is reported up to B level.
     - For all other sources evidence is reported for A level only.
 1. For every event/treatment/direction combination only the highest level of evidence is reported:
     - Off-label evidence is only reported in case the evidence level is higher than the highest on-label evidence.
 1. Clinical trials are only reported when they are on-label.
 1. There is some evidence that is never reported regardless of what event caused them or what their evidence level is. These are:
    - Evidence based on an event affecting TP53.
    - Evidence for non-specific chemotherapy, aspirin or steroids. 
    
## PROTECT output

PROTECT produces a tsv with every applicable evidence after consolidation has been performed.

treatment | Name of the treatment (trial or drug(s)) | Vemurafenib
onLabel | Whether the evidence is valid for the specific tumor for which the match has been made | true/false
